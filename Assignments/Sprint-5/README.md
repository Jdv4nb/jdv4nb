Setup has not changed from the original.


I did not successfully implement the idea I pitched in the previous sprint.  The idea was to create a forum-like application that would allow people to post and respond to other posts.  I have very little experience with Python and, upon doing some research, realized that was a much larger task than I had originally expected.  My research included html templates, linking php with python to add pages, and also including css.  I ended up creating a simple page with minor css styling and some embedded html that gives information about me.  Ideally, I want to improve this page so others can have customized information.

Below are a couple of the links I visited and read.  Though there were more that I didn't list.
