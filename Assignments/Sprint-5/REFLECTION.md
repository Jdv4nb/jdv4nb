I was able to get all parts of the application to work.  I feel like I have a solid grasp on SSO's after research.  The videos helped my understanding consiberably and I was very excited to see a working final product.  I hope by the end of the semester to have a more functional user interface.  Currently the UI is very minimal and does not offer much in terms of usability.
