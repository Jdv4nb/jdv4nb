I looked at OpenID Connect, OAuth, and uPort to decide which I wanted to use for my Single Sign On application.  I decided on using OAuth.

I chose OAuth because it is the one I have seen most often and it seemed the most familiar.  It is used by google, facebook, and many other apps that I have used in the past.

I made it to the point of creating buttons that should be able to access a Google login page but was not able to successfully display the page and authenticate.  I spent some time looking into the issue but did not find a solution.  My guess is that the issues lies somewhere in the inclusion of the hello.js script.  This is the biggest obstacle I faced in the process of attempting to create this application.  I spent a good amount of time doing research.
