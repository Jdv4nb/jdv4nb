I found the articles about open source software very interesting.  I feel like I would personally participate in open source software to learn more about it myself.  From what I understand, reading through existing code and understanding the work of others is one of the best ways to improve as a programmer and I think that's a good reason in and of itself.  Additionally, I like the idea of being able to look at somebody else's work and try to find mistakes or make helpful additions.
